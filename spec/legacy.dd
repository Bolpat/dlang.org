$(HEADERNAV_TOC)

    $(P To maintain compatibility with older D code, many legacy features remain supported.
    If the $(TT -wo) compiler command line switch is used, the compiler will give warning messages
    for each use of a legacy feature.
    This page describes each legacy feature that is supported, with a suggestion of how to
    modernize the code.
